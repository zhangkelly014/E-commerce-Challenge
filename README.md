# E-commerce-Challenge
Goal: provide a dashboard to the Finance department about the sales results for Q1.

A JSON array that contains orders, following this structure:

- Order ID  
- Customer  
  - ID
  - Name
  - Email
- Total Order price
- Creation date
- Line items. For each one:
  - ID
  - Product ID
  - Product SKU
  - Product Name
  - Price

To keep it simple, we removed taxes, discounts. Note also that all prices are in USD (US Dollars).
